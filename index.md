I am a second year mathematics student at the University of Warwick with a strong interest in geometric measure theory and differential 
geometry, occasionally dabbling in geometry processing as well. Right now, I am working on a funded research project with Professor 
[Felix Schulze](https://www.felixschulze.eu/) on Berstein's Problem for minimal surfaces. I recently attended the [LMS
summer school](http://www.lms.macs.hw.ac.uk/) set up to introduce modern concepts to the top mathematics undergraduates in the UK.

Previously, I was a research fellow at the 2021 [Summer Geometry Institute](https://sgi.mit.edu/) hosted by MIT and did work on 
[fluid flow simulation](http://summergeometry.org/sgi2021/incompressible-flows-on-meshes/), 
[elastic curves and active bending](http://summergeometry.org/sgi2021/elastic-curves-and-active-bending/), 
and [triply periodic non-manifold minimal surfaces](http://summergeometry.org/sgi2021/minimal-surfaces-but-with-saddle-points/). 
I returned to this programme as a student volunteer in 2022.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, reading and creating art (see [gallery](https://natasha-diederen.github.io/pages/gallery/)).
